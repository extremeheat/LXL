LXL contains a simple templating system that allows you to conditionally insert data into the markdown at runtime.

To insert variables, you use `%%%(VARIABLE_NAME)%%%`. To insert a string based on a specific condition, you use ```%%%[...] if CONDITION%%%``` or with an else clause, ```%%%[...] if BOOLEAN_VAR else [...]%%%```. Note that the square brackets work like quotation mark strings in programming languages, so you can escape them with a backslash, like `\]`.

For example, the line:
```
Your name is %%%(NAME)%%%, and you answer questions for the user%%%[, based on your prompt] if HAS_PROMPT%%%.
You are running over %%%[the Google AI Studio playground] if IS_AI_STUDIO else [the %%%(LLM_NAME)%%% API]%%%.
```

Would be loaded in JS like this:
```js
const { importPromptSync } = require('langxlang')
const prompt = importPromptSync('path-to-prompt.md', { NAME: 'Omega', HAS_PROMPT: true, IS_AI_STUDIO: false, LLM_NAME: 'Gemini 1.5 Pro })
```

And would result in:
```md
Your name is Omega, and you answer questions for the user, based on your prompt.
You are running over the Gemini 1.5 Pro API.
```

There are also if statements, which can be used to conditionally include or exclude parts of the markdown. For example:
```
Hello!
%%%IF IS_AI_STUDIO
You are running in Google AI Studio.
%%%ELSE
You are running via API.
%%%ENDIF
```

This would result in:
```md
Hello!
You are running via API.
```
